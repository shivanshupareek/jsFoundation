/*

In Javascript, there are three types of variables: 
    1. var
    2. let
    3. const
*/

//let's start with var

// There are three elements inside a variable, the type of variable(i.e. var/let/const), the name ofthe variable, and the value of the variable.)

var x = 10; //x = 10

//now, we can change the value of the variable "x" as many times as we want..

x = 20; //x is now changed from x = 10 to x = 20

//when we change the value of a variable(var), we do not have to use the var keyword again, only the name and the new value.
//using the var keyword again will create a new variable with the same name, but a different value, that will create an error.
